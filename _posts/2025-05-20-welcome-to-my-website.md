This has been a long time coming.  I've written a smattering of posts over the years, but had the time to do it for myself.

Most of my content will be tech and/or business related.  But at times there will be content I publish that won't be related to technology at all.  I have a wide variety of interests, and if I find something cool I want to share, I will.  Maybe I'll post it to help me remember for my own sake.  

My opinions will start to show a bit more concretely in the digital world.  As a closet introvert I've been mute on a lot of topics - whether it's because I've been restricted by employment or my takes would ruffle feathers.  Take it or leave it.  My hope is you find something interesting and it helps you out in some way.

### Old stuff

If I can pull together any of my old content from the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) or with the dust bunnies buried on a disk somewhere - I'll get it republished here in an archive section.

### ...And here we go...
If there is anything you are interested in and would like to me to write about - maybe something we built together (or I built for you), a situation we encountered, why the sky is blue - fire me a message in my [contact form](/contact) and I'll get on it!

Thanks - enjoy the ride.
