Welcome!

This has been a long time coming.  I've written a smattering of posts over the years, but had the time to do it for myself.

Most of my content will be tech and business related.  But at times there will be content I publish the won't be related to technology at all.  I have a wide variety of interests, and if I find something cool I want to share with you, or remember for my own sake, I'll throw something out here to memorialize it a bit.

My opinions will start to show a bit more concretely in the digital world.  Take it or leave it.  My hope is you find something interesting and it helps you out in some way.

If I can pull together any of my old content from the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) or with the dust bunnies buried on a disk somewhere - I'll get it republished here in an archive section.

Finally - if there is anything you are interested in and would like to me to write about - maybe something we built together, a situation we encountered, my thoughts on why the sky is blue - fire me a message in my [contact form](/contact) and I'll get on it!

Thanks - enjoy the ride.
